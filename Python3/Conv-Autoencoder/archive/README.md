# Convolutional Autoencoders - Tensorflow

This is the original, untouched code from my 2017 project on convolutional autoencoders for image compression
This folder serves as an archive for the tensorflow implementation of the project.

I do not recommend attempting to run this, but it should work given the `train_32x32.mat` and `test_32x32.mat` files for the [Stanford SVHN Dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/)
