# projects

## What is this?

This repository contains a collection of small side-projects I have written.
These mini-projects are curated and maintained by myself, but not actively developed.
None of these are meant to be long-term commitments, but rather small exercises to keep my skills sharp and/or learn a new language, library, or framework.

## Why a monorepo?

The mono-repository structure allows for many small projects to be collected in a single place, allowing for a much more maintainable experience: I can easily view and make changes to all of my projects for a single language, and review skills as necessary.

Further, this many projects can clutter a github page and make it difficult to discern major from minor projects.
So, all major projects (those that are under active development, make use of a licence, and/or allow community involvement) will have their own repository.
