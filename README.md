# projects

## What is this?

This repository contains a collection of small side-projects I have written.
These mini-projects are curated and maintained by myself, but not all are under active development.
None of these are meant to be long-term commitments, but rather small exercises to keep my skills sharp and/or learn a new language, framework, algorithm or technique, or just to solve a problem.

## Why only one repository?

The mono-repository structure allows for projects to be collected in one place, so they can be much more easily mantained over time.

This many projects can really clutter a github page, and make it difficult to discern major from minor projects.
Here, I can maintain an overview of my past minor projects, and dedicate an entire repository to major projects under active development/maintenance.

The mono-repository structure allows for many projects to be collected in a single place, allowing for a much more maintainable experience: I can easily view and make changes to all of my projects for a single language, and review skills as necessary.
