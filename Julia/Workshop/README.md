# Julia Workshop
Notes and code for the [OIST Julia Workshop](https://groups.oist.jp/grad/skill-pill-67)

Sessions 3, 6, and 8 were directed work sessions where a simple project was constructed.
For this project, I implemented unsigned addition for arbitrarily precision integers on the GPU, as described [here](http://old.cescg.org/CESCG-2015/papers/Langer-Arbitrary-Precision_Arithmetics_on_the_GPU.pdf)
