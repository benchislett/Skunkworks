# Arbitrary Precision GPU Computing in Julia

Project implemented during directed work sessions at the
[OIST Julia Workshop](https://groups.oist.jp/grad/skill-pill-67)

Implementation contains a custom gpu-based bigint type and infinite precision unsigned addition, as described in [this paper](http://old.cescg.org/CESCG-2015/papers/Langer-Arbitrary-Precision_Arithmetics_on_the_GPU.pdf)
