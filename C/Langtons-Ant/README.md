## Installation

### Dependencies

There are currently no dependencies of the program.
The argument parsing is done natively through `getopt`,
and the output is also native through primitive FileIO

### Makefile

The executable is built with gcc to a file named `simulate`, via the `make` command.

`make clean` will clear any object and executable files lingering, as well as resetting the output image.

## Usage
