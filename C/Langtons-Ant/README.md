## Description

## Installation

### Dependencies

The only nonstandard dependency is the [cairo graphics library](https://cairographics.org/)

### Makefile

The executable is built with gcc to a file named `generate`, via the `make` command.

`make clean` will clear any object and executable files lingering, as well as resetting the output image.

## Usage
